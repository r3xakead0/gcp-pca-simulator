  "question": "You are using Cloud SQL as the database backend for a large CRM deployment. You want to scale as usage increases and ensure that you don't run out of storage, maintain 75% CPU usage cores, and keep replication lag below 60 seconds. What are the correct steps to meet your requirements?",
  "options": [
    {
      "key": "A",
      "text": "1. Enable automatic storage increase for the instance. 2. Create a Stackdriver alert when CPU usage exceeds 75%, and change the instance type to reduce CPU usage. 3. Create a Stackdriver alert for replication lag, and shard the database to reduce replication time."
    },
    {
      "key": "B",
      "text": "1. Enable automatic storage increase for the instance. 2. Change the instance type to a 32-core machine type to keep CPU usage below 75%. 3. Create a Stackdriver alert for replication lag, and deploy memcache to reduce load on the master."
    },
    {
      "key": "C",
      "text": "1. Create a Stackdriver alert when storage exceeds 75%, and increase the available storage on the instance to create more space. 2. Deploy memcached to reduce CPU load. 3. Change the instance type to a 32-core machine type to reduce replication lag."
