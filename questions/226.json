  "question": "For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. You start to build a new application that uses a few Cloud Functions for the backend. One use case requires a Cloud Function func_display to invoke another Cloud Function func_query. You want func_query only to accept invocations from func_display. You also want to follow Google's recommended best practices. What should you do?",

      "key": "A",
      "text": "Create a token and pass it in as an environment variable to func_display. When invoking func_query, include the token in the request. Pass the same token to func_query and reject the invocation if the tokens are different."

      "key": "B",
      "text": "Make func_query 'Require authentication.' Create a unique service account and associate it to func_display. Grant the service account invoker role for func_query. Create an id token in func_display and include the token to the request when invoking func_query."
