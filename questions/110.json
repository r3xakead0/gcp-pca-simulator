  "question": "Your company has a Google Cloud project that uses BigQuery for data warehousing. There are some tables that contain personally identifiable information (PII). Only the compliance team may access the PII. The other information in the tables must be available to the data science team. You want to minimize cost and the time it takes to assign appropriate access to the tables. What should you do?",

    {

      "text": "1. From the dataset where you have the source data, create views of tables that you want to share, excluding PII. 2. Assign an appropriate project-level IAM role to the members of the data science team. 3. Assign access controls to the dataset that contains the view."
    },
