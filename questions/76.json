  "question": "Your company has a Google Workspace account and Google Cloud Organization. Some developers in the company have created Google Cloud projects outside of the Google Cloud Organization. You want to create an Organization structure that allows developers to create projects, but prevents them from modifying production projects. You want to manage policies for all projects centrally and be able to set more restrictive policies for production projects. You want to minimize disruption to users and developers when business needs change in the future. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. Now should you design the Organization structure?",
