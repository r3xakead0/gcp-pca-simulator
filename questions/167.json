  "question": "Your company has an enterprise application running on Compute Engine that requires high availability and high performance. The application has been deployed on two instances in two zones in the same region in active-passive mode. The application writes data to a persistent disk. In the case of a single zone outage, that data should be immediately made available to the other instance in the other zone. You want to maximize performance while minimizing downtime and data loss. What should you do?",
