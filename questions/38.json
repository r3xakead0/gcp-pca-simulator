  "question": "Your organization uses separate Google Cloud projects for shared services, development, testing, and production. •\tThe shared services project hosts your private CI/CD runners and a central Artifact Registry •\tThe development, testing, and production projects host the GKE clusters where applications are deployed. You need to design an architecture that allows the CI/CD runners to connect to the GKE clusters and the clusters to pull images from Artifact Registry, all using private IP addresses. However, direct network traffic between the development, testing, and production environments must be strictly prohibited. What should you do?",
