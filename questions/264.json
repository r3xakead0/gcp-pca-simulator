  "question": "For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. TerramEarth has a legacy web application that you cannot migrate to cloud. However, you still want to build a cloud-native way to monitor the application. If the application goes down, you want the URL to point to a \"Site is unavailable\" page as soon as possible. You also want your Ops team to receive a notification for the issue. You need to build a reliable solution for minimum cost. What should you do?",
