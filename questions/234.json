  "question": "Your company and one of its partners each have a Google Cloud project in separate organizations. Your company's project (prj-a) runs in Virtual Private Cloud (vpc-a). The partner's project (prj-b) runs in vpc-b. There are two instances running on vpc-a and one instance running on vpc-b. Subnets defined in both VPCs are not overlapping. You need to ensure that all instances communicate with each other via internal IPs, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput. What should you do?",
