  "question": "You are migrating a critical on-premises inventory management application to Google Cloud. The application is a monolith with a traditional relational database, and the immediate business goal is a rapid data center exit. The monolith is exposing an API to other business critical applications. The long-term vision is to modernize the application into globally distributed, cloud-native services to support the company’s expansion. You need to design the initial cloud architecture to ensure that future modernization causes the least possible disruption to other applications that depend on inventory data. The future modernization might require the API to change structure. What should you do?",
