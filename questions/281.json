  "question": "You are migrating third-party applications from optimized on-premises virtual machines to Google Cloud. You are unsure about the optimum CPU and memory options. The applications have a consistent usage pattern across multiple weeks. You want to optimize resource usage for the lowest cost. What should you do?",
  "options": [
    {
      "key": "A",
      "text": "Create an instance template with the smallest available machine type, and use an image of the third-party application taken from a current on-premises virtual machine. Create a managed instance group that uses average CPU utilization to autoscale the number of instances in the group. Modify the average CPU utilization threshold to optimize the number of instances running."
    },
    {
      "key": "B",
      "text": "Create an App Engine flexible environment, and deploy the third-party application using a Dockerfile and a custom runtime. Set CPU and memory options similar to your application's current on-premises virtual machine in the app.yaml file."
    },
    {
      "key": "C",
      "text": "Create multiple Compute Engine instances with varying CPU and memory options. Install the Cloud Monitoring agent, and deploy the third-party application on each of them. Run a load test with high traffic levels on the application, and use the results to determine the optimal settings."
    },
    {
      "key": "D",
      "text": "Create a Compute Engine instance with CPU and memory options similar to your application's current on-premises virtual machine. Install the Cloud Monitoring agent, and deploy the third-party application. Run a load test with normal traffic levels on the application, and follow the Rightsizing Recommendations in the Cloud Console."
