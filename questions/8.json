  "question": "You are designing the storage architecture for a financial analytics platform. The platform ingests and stores terabytes of transactional data daily, which is used for both real-time fraud detection and long-term historical analysis. Transaction data from the last 30 days must be accessible with very low latency for the fraud detection engine. Data older than 30 days is accessed infrequently for quarterly reports, where retrieval times of a few seconds are acceptable. All data must be retained for five years to meet compliance regulations. You need to design a solution as cost-effective as possible. What should you do?",
