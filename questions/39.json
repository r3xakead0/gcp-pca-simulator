  "number": 211,
  "question": "You are architecting a new application feature for a healthcare provider based in Qatar. The feature needs to summarize sensitive patient notes that are submitted by clinicians. A critical requirement is that the content of these patient notes must never be processed outside of Qatar's borders. You want to use a powerful, pre-trained generative model for the summarization task while strictly adhering to the data residency constraint. What should you do?",
  "options": [
    {
      "key": "A",
      "text": "Write application code that sends the patient notes explicitly to the Gemini API endpoint in Qatar for summarization. Protect the API by VPC-Service Controls."
    },
    {
      "key": "B",
      "text": "Use Vertex AI Model Garden to select a Gemma model. Deploy this model to a Vertex AI Endpoint within a Google Cloud region located in Qatar."
    },
    {
      "key": "C",
      "text": "Use the Cloud Natural Language API to analyze the text and configure it to generate a summary of the patient notes."
    },
    {
      "key": "D",
      "text": "Gather a large, anonymized dataset of medical notes. Use Vertex AI Training to train a custom summarization model from scratch, deploying it in a Qatar region."
